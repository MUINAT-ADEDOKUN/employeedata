# employeedata
The aim of the project is to analyze a dataset containing employee records. Key analyses include demographic insights (gender, age groups), contact information (email domains, completeness), termination patterns (reasons, exit dates), active employees vs. future starters, geographical distribution, basic statistics, pattern detection, and potential predictive analysis. These analyses would involve data cleaning, SQL queries, and data visualization. The goal is to gain valuable insights into employee demographics, turnover, and other relevant factors to inform HR decisions and strategies.
